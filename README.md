Calculator to estimate the Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) level based on the amount of alcohol consumed, the time elapsed, gender, and body. Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is a commonly used measure of alcohol intoxication, also known as drunkenness. It is expressed as a per mille (â€°) of alcohol per volume of blood.

Disclaimer:
This calculator is for information purposes only. There are many variables that mean this tool cannot fully determine your BAC level, and therefore whether an individual is able to lawfully drive a vehicle. I strongly suggest that if you have any alcohol in your body: do not drive.
